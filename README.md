# Reforested
A Reimagining/Love Letter to [Forestry](https://modrinth.com/mod/forestry) and [Binnie's Mods](https://modrinth.com/mod/binnies-mods)

The idea of this project is to reimplement the mechanics of forestry but in slighty different ways.

The codebase will be fundamentally different as this is being developed from scratch

its a bit like what [Industrial Forgoing](https://modrinth.com/mod/industrial-foregoing) is to [MineFactory Reloaded](https://ftbwiki.org/MineFactory_Reloaded)

## Planned Features

- Many trees starting from few trees, with a breeding system to make your way to the cooler ones
- A reinterpretation of the Bee system (using the vanilla ones)
- the general tech layout of Forestry, from electron tubes to compartments

## Planned (New) Features
- A grass/bamboo/sugarcane breeding system
