# Reforested
A Reimagining/Love Letter to [Forestry](https://modrinth.com/mod/forestry) and [Binnie's Mods](https://modrinth.com/mod/binnies-mods)

The idea of this project is to reimplement the mechanics of forestry but in slighty different ways.

The codebase will be fundamentally different as this is being developed from scratch

its a bit like what [Industrial Forgoing](https://modrinth.com/mod/industrial-foregoing) is to [MineFactory Reloaded](https://ftbwiki.org/MineFactory_Reloaded)

## Current Features
- Bees! some bees make combs that make cool things, you can find the new bees in hives, they can mutate if there are 2 in a hive
- Trees! new trees! they have different planks and woodstuffs, you can breed trees by putting saplings next to Tree Canes, some trees have fruit!
- Compartments - they are like chests, but have multiple tabs and have a search bar
- Multi-Farms - a block that requires power, but will place saplings and crops and harvest them (This may change in the future!) - they are suppose to be programmable with circuit boards, they aren't yet
- Peat you place "Block O' Bog" and eventually it turns into peat, that you can put into a peat engine to generate power

## Planned Features

- Many trees starting from few trees, with a breeding system to make your way to the cooler ones
- A reinterpretation of the Bee system (using the vanilla ones)
- the general tech layout of Forestry, from electron tubes to compartments

## Planned (New) Features
- A grass/bamboo/sugarcane breeding system
