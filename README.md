# Reforested
A Reimagining/Love Letter to [Forestry](https://modrinth.com/mod/forestry) and [Binnie's Mods](https://modrinth.com/mod/binnies-mods)

The idea of this project is to reimplement (and add new) mechanics from forestry but in slighty different ways.

This mod has been effectively written from scratch, so their will be major and minor differences from the inspiration

its a bit like what [Industrial Forgoing](https://modrinth.com/mod/industrial-foregoing) is to [MineFactory Reloaded](https://ftbwiki.org/MineFactory_Reloaded)

## Current Features
- Bees! some bees make combs that make cool things, you can find the new bees in hives, they can mutate if there are 2 in a hive
- Trees! new trees! they have different planks and woodstuffs, you can breed trees by putting saplings next to Tree Canes, some trees have fruit!
- Compartments - they are like chests, but have multiple tabs and have a search bar
- Multi-Farms - a block that requires power, but will place saplings and crops and harvest them (This may change in the future!) - they are supposed to be programmable with circuit boards, they aren't yet
- Peat - you place "Block O' Bog" and eventually it turns into peat, that you can put into a peat engine to generate power
- Apiarists gear - to stop you angering the bees, shame you need to first work with bees to make it...
- Digger's Backpack - automagically picks up the stuff you don't want clogging your inventory when mining
- Botanist's Backpack - picks up seeds and flowers (both backpacks can deposit their contents in an inventory by shift-using them)
- An information screen on a keybind, so you can look up things in the mod (default is "[" )

## Planned Features

- More trees starting from few trees, with a breeding system to make your way to the cooler ones
- more of the forestry and Binnies tech, like stills and carpenters

## Planned (New) Features
- A grass/bamboo/sugarcane breeding system
